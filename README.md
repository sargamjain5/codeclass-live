# 🎓 CodeClass Live

CodeClass Live is a real-time collaborative learning platform designed for **tutors and students** to conduct interactive coding classes and system design sessions.

It combines **live coding, visual explanations, AI assistance, and video communication** into one seamless virtual classroom.

## Why CodeClass Live?

Most online classes are either:
- video-only (low engagement), or  
- code-only (no explanation layer)

CodeClass Live bridges both — enabling tutors to **teach, explain, collaborate, and get AI assistance live**, just like a physical classroom.
